<div id="panel">In 1900 fox had his own fur business which he sold in order to get into the film industry in 1904 when he bought a nickelodeon in Brooklyn. Once Fox was done setting up his new Nickelodeon, he opened up several movie theaters and bought film prints to project the film in his theaters. Once his shows became successful, Fox would begin to purchase more nickelodeon and turn them into movie theaters. Fox then created a studio, which was called Box Office Attraction company in 1913 which distributed and produced films such as Winsor McCay’s Gertie the Dinosaur and A Fool There Was starring Theda Bara. In 1915 Fox would rename his studio Fox Films. Since Fox films was founded, it would produce and distribute films throughout the late 1910s to 1935 Fox would get big named actors at the time such as Theda Barra, Tom Mix, Buck Jones, George O' Brian, and many others. He also got directors  like F.W Murnau, John Ford, Frank Borzage, Howard Hawks and many others as Well. Fox produced many films in the silent era of films as well as getting involved in some productions for some films, He also created a Soundsystem called Movietone which is audio in the film negative itself and was first used in Sunrise: A Song of Two Humans and then used in Seventh Heaven. There were several competing sound systems and Movietone was the best and more sustainable. Other studios such as Universal used Movietone for films such as The Man Who Laughs with permission from William Fox. Fox Film was the first studio to discontented silent pictures for sound pictures and other studios followed shortly after.</div>

    <p>While Fox Film was a successful studio, The decline began in the late 1920s. In 1929, after the death of Marcus Leow, who was The founder of Leow’s Corporation, Fox wanted to buy the company to expand his business. The president at Leow’s Inc, Nicholas Schenck, wanted to sell part of the firm to Fox film corporation. This would give Fox control of Leow’s theater and MGM (Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer), but Fox wanted all the control. The bosses at MGM, Louis B. Mayer and Irving Thalberg were not happy and used their government connections to get the DOJ to sue Fox and his studio for violating antitrust laws. Fox got into a serious automobile accident, which injured him. By the time he was able to recover, the stock market crash of 1929 began and gave him no chance of merging with Loew’s company even If there was no antitrust lawsuit. Around 1929 William Fox stepped down as CEO of Fox Film Corporation and the last thing he worked on was the 1930 film The Big Trial starring John Wayne. In 1932, Fox film filed for bankruptcy and was sold to Sidney Kent. The first thing he did was merge 20th Century Pictures into 20th century-Fox, which was a profitable studio in Hollywood. In 1935 the merger became complete and 20th Century Fox was born. </p>
