        <p>“We should strive to welcome change and challenges, because they are what help us grow. With out them we grow weak like the Eloi in comfort and security. We need to constantly be challenging ourselves in order to strengthen our character and increase our intelligence. ”</p>
    
        
    <header><h1>My responce to this quote</h1></header>
              <p> Don’t be resistant to change and challenge yourself. It is something that is bound to happen. It could happen today, tomorrow, or a couple of years. Challenge helps us increase our skill. You should enbrace change whenever you have the chance. Change can be a good thing.</p>

       <h1> The Invisible Man-1897 </h1>       
              </header>
              <p>“And there it was, on a shabby bed in a tawdry, ill-lighted bedroom, surrounded by a crowd of ignorant and excited people, broken and wounded, betrayed and unpitied, that Griffin, the first of all men to make himself invisible, Griffin, the most gifted physicist the world has ever seen, ended in infinite disaster his strange and terrible career.” </p>
      
  <header><h1>My responce to this quote</h1></header>
             
    <p>There are plenty of bedrooms that are surrounded by people. How those people are and how they act is unpredictable. Some might be arrogant, hypocritical, or stupid. Some might be helpful, quiet, or kind. </p>
