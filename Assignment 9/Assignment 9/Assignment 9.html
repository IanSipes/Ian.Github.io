A portal opens to an alternative world, where another version of you exists. Write down a conversation you might have with this counterpart person. What kind of life are they living? How are they different from you? What is the name for this alter ego?

When I meet an alternative version of myself, I ask what happens in your timeline. Alternative me says that in his timeline, we live in Europe instead of the US. He also said that his people's worldview on things like food, politics and entertainment is different from ours. We also had a conversation about if the two worlds will clash. Alternative me says that it would be a disaster and can result in the end of both of us. So, alternatively, I decided to leave my world and go back to his world.

The first thing that comes to my mind right now is how am I going to do the project for this class as well as a project for my image class. The type of project was to create moving posters. This is a type of project that I did before in another class. It looks like this time I am going to make it using after effects. Before, I used illustrator for my moving posters. I’m thinking about using a poster that I’ve made before or creating one from scratch.   </p>

The color red represents death because of its relation to blood and bruises. Red can mean many things besides death and blood. Red can  also mean sunset because of the red colors mixed with orange and yellow. To me this represents something that  is about to happen meaning that it is about to become dark. It can mean something good. It can get you more attention and make you more likely to make you look sleek. Overall, red can mean good or bad depending on the situation that you are in.
