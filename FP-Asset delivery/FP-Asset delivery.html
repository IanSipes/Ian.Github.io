	<button>About</button>  
     <p id="B">We are a group of people that were rejected by "normal" society. we are here to fix what is broken. The Shadow Society is made up of several positions. First there is the leader who is labeled as the expert in society, culture, and economics. Then there are the researchers who look for new information to show the leader. Next there are the scientists. Unlike the researchers, scientists focused more on studying the human body, the chemicals we consume, and the weather. The scientist for sheep brings data which would be sent to the leader and sees if it goes into good use or not. The secret Society’s population is slowly growing as more and more people feel unsatisfied with the society that they are in so they decide to start over.  </p>

In order to become a member of the Secrets Society, there are three things that you need to do. The first thing is that you need to have extensive knowledge with economics and social classes. then you need to have proof that you were ostracized from regular society. The final requirement is that you need to distance yourself from your friends and family and pretend like you’re dead. Overall, getting into the secret society takes lots of working research in order to join.    </p>
