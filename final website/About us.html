        <p>Founded in 1972 by Will Got and John Jacob in Las Vegas, Nevada. Their goal is to make the lives of people better and to give people hope in a hopeless world. The idea started when John was treated poorly by society throughout his childhood and wished that he could start a movement that makes people question the position that they are in and challenges the status quo. Eventually around his early adult years, John met Will and decided to become friends and work together on many projects and had a good relationship. During this time, many people around where John and Will lived were struggling financially and socially. This gave John a good idea which led him and Will to create Alternative Realty as a organization witch includes things such as a website, a team, and membership benefits. This is so that the organization can be professional and make a better world. Over the years, Alternative Realty opened up many location around the world and is supported in multiple language. We hope this would help inspire people to create new organizations and find more ways to improve people lives even more.
